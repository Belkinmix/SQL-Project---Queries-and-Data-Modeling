An in-school project where I wrote business level SQL queries via MySQL to extract insights, 
developed an ER Model and remodeled a database via Hackolade - attributes, data types, PK & FK, cardinality.

Thank you very much for checking on this small university project !

To run it: 1)Simply download all the files and put then in a single folder on your desktop or where most convenient for you.
2)Make sure to have MySQL & Hackolade installed, or equivalent.
